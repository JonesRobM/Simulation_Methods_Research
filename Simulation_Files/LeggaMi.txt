Hello and welcome to this directory detailing all of the python script that I have written and executed for this research project. 
I hope that you are comfortably sat and have a refreshing beverage while you evaluate my scripts.

Lei pregghiamo a trovare dentro, tutti i file che abbiamo usato durante questo projetto.

In the sub-directory, Histogram_Analysis, you shall find the script used to present the Umbrella Sampling histograms in addition to the scripts used to evaluate and quantify overlap.
Moreover, one may find all of the files necessary for one to re-perform these scripts in order to verify ther veracity of our own plots.

One may also locate the Force_Distance sub-directory which contains two further sub folders dedicated to the hairpin and helix proteins. 
Within these, one may locate the scripts used to analyse the force vs distance profiles featured in the complete project.
As was true before, one may also find all of the source files ued to generate such plots should one be motivated to verify our results with their own.

Finally, one is invited to view the Velocity_Analysis sub-directory.
Here, we feature data generated from the four varied velocity pulling simulations and have provided a code which is able to create some beautiful plots.

The author of this repository and indeed of the report article (who happen to be one and the same) wishes to thank their viewers and readers for their curiosity
and for their time dedicated to the inspection of the author's work.

Grazie mille a tutti.

Speriamo che si diverta qui.
